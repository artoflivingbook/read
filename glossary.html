</p>

<p>
    <strong>mettā</strong>. Selfless love and good will. One of the qualities of a pure mind. <strong>Mettā-bhāvanā</strong>—the systematic cultivation of <strong>mettā</strong> by a technique of meditation.

</p>


<p>
    <strong>nibbāna</strong>. Extinction; freedom from suffering; the ultimate reality; the unconditioned. (Sanskrit <strong>nirvāṇa</strong>.)

</p>

<p>
    <strong>Pāli</strong>. Line; text. The texts recording the teaching of the Buddha; hence the language of these texts. Historical, linguistic, and archaeological evidence indicate that Pāli was a language actually spoken in northern India at or near the time of the Buddha. Later the texts were translated into Sanskrit, which was exclusively a literary language.

</p>

<p>
    <strong>paññā</strong>. Wisdom. The third of the three trainings by which the Noble Eightfold Path is practised (see <strong>ariya aṭṭhaṅgika magga</strong>). There are three kinds of wisdom: <strong>suta-mayā paññā</strong>—literally, “wisdom gained from listening to others,” i.e., received wisdom; <strong>cintā-mayā paññā</strong>—wisdom gained by intellectual analysis; and <strong>bhāvanā-mayā paññā</strong>—wisdom developing from direct, personal experience.

</p>

<p>
    <strong>samādhi</strong>. Concentration, control of one's mind. The second of the three trainings by which the Noble Eightfold Path is practised <strong>(see ariya aṭṭhaṅgika magga)</strong>.

</p>

<p>
    <strong>sammā-sati</strong>. Right awareness. See <strong>sati</strong>.

</p>


<p>
    <strong>sampajañña</strong>. Understanding of the totality of the human phenomenon. i.e., insight into its impermanent nature at the level of sensations.

</p>

<p>
    <strong>saṃsāra</strong>. Cycle of rebirth; conditioned world; world of suffering.

</p>

<p>
    <strong>saṅgha</strong>. Congregation; community of <strong>ariyas</strong>, i.e., those who have experienced nibbāna</strong>; community of Buddhist monks or nuns; a member of the <strong>ariya-saṅgha</strong>, <strong>bhikkhu-saṅgha</strong>, or <strong>bhikkhuṇīsaṅgha</strong>.

</p>


<p>
    <strong>saṅkhāra</strong>. (Mental) formation; volitional activity; mental reaction; mental conditioning. One of the four aggregates or processes of the mind, along with <strong>viññaṇa</strong>, <strong>saññā</strong>, and <strong>vedanā</strong>. (Sanskrit <strong>samskāra</strong>.)

</p>

<p>
    <strong>saṅkhāra-upekkhā</strong> / <strong>saṅkhārupekkhā</strong>. Literally, equanimity toward the saṅkhāras</strong>. A stage in the practice of Vipassana, subsequent to the experience of <strong>bhāṅga</strong>, in which old impurities lying dormant in the unconscious rise to the surface level of the mind, manifesting themselves as physical sensations. By maintaining equanimity <strong>(upekkhā)</strong> toward these sensations, the meditator creates no new <strong>saṅkhāras</strong>, and allows the old ones to be eradicated. Thus, the process gradually leads to the eradication of all <strong>saṅkhāras</strong>.

</p>

<p>
    <strong>saññā</strong>. Perception, recognition. One of the four mental aggregates or processes, along with <strong>vedanā</strong>, <strong>viññāṇa</strong>, and <strong>saṅkhāra</strong>. It is ordinarily conditioned by one's past <strong>saṅkhāras</strong>, and therefore conveys a distorted image of reality. In the practice of Vipassana, <strong>saññā</strong> is changed into <strong>paññā</strong>, the understanding of reality as it is. It becomes <strong>anicca-saññā</strong>, <strong>dukkha-saññā</strong>, <strong>anattāsaññā</strong>, <strong>asubhasaññā</strong>—that is, the perception of impermanence, suffering, egolessness, and the illusory nature of beauty.

</p>


<p>
    <strong>sati</strong>. Awareness. <strong>Ānāpāna-sati</strong>-awareness of respiration. <strong>Sammā-sati</strong>-right awareness, a constituent of the Noble Eightfold Path (see <strong>ariya aṭṭhaṅgika magga</strong>).

</p>

<p>
    <strong>satipaṭṭhāna</strong>. the establishing of awareness. There are four interconnected aspects of <strong>satipaṭṭhāna</strong>: (1) observation of the body <strong>(kāyānupassanā)</strong>; (2) observation of sensations arising within the body <strong>(vedanānupassanā)</strong>; (3) observation of the mind <strong>(cittānupassanā)</strong>; (4) observation of the contents of the mind <strong>(dhammānupassanā)</strong>. All four are included in the observation of sensations, since sensations are directly related to both body and mind.

</p>

<p>
    <strong>Siddhattha</strong>. Literally, “one who has accomplished his task.” The personal name of the historical Buddha. (Sanskrit <strong>Siddhārtha</strong>.)

</p>


<p>
    <strong>sīla</strong>. Morality, abstaining from physical and vocal actions that cause harm to others and oneself. The first of the three trainings by which the Noble Eightfold Path is practised (see <strong>ariya aṭṭhaṅgika magga</strong>).

</p>

<p>
    <strong>suta-mayā paññā</strong>. Received wisdom. See <strong>paññā</strong>.

</p>

<p>
    <strong>Sutta</strong>. Discourse of the Buddha or one of his leading disciples. (Sanskrit <strong>sūtra</strong>).

</p>


<p>
    <strong>taṇhā</strong>. Literally, “thirst.” Includes both craving and its reverse image of aversion. The Buddha identified <strong>taṇhā</strong> as the cause of suffering in his first sermon, the “Discourse Setting in Motion the Wheel of Dhamma” <strong>(Dhamma-cakkappavattana Sutta)</strong>. In the Chain of Conditioned Arising, he explained that <strong>taṇhā</strong> originates as a reaction to sensation (see above, p. 49).

</p>

<p>
    <strong>Tathāgata</strong>. Literally “thus-gone” or “thus-come” One who by walking on the path of reality has reached the ultimate reality, i.e., an enlightened person. The term by which the Buddha commonly referred to himself.

</p>

<p>
    <strong>Theravāda</strong>. Literally, “teaching of the elders.” The teachings of the Buddha, in the form in which they have been preserved in the countries of South Asia (Burma, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia). Generally recognized as the oldest form of the teachings.

</p>

<p>
    <strong>Tipiṭaka</strong>. Literally, “three baskets.” The three collections of the teachings of the Buddha, namely: (1) <strong>Vinaya-piṭaka</strong>—the collection of monastic discipline; (2) <strong>Sutta-piṭaka</strong>—the collection of discourses; (3) <strong>Abhidhamma-piṭaka</strong>—“the collection of higher teaching,” i.e., systematic philosophical exegesis of the Dhamma. (Sanskrit <strong>Tripiṭaka</strong>.)

</p>

<p>
    <strong>vedanā</strong>. Sensation. One of the four mental aggregates or processes, along with <strong>viññaṇa</strong>, <strong>saññā</strong>, and <strong>saṅkhāra</strong>. Described by the Buddha as having both mental and physical aspects; therefore <strong>vedanā</strong> offers a means to examine the totality of mind and body. In the Chain of Conditioned Arising, the Buddha explained that <strong>taṇhā</strong>, the cause of suffering, originates as a reaction to <strong>vedanā</strong> (see above, p. 49). By learning to observe <strong>vedanā</strong> objectively, one can avoid any new reactions of craving or aversion, and can experience directly within oneself the reality of impermanence <strong>(anicca)</strong>. This experience is essential for the development of detachment, leading to liberation of the mind. <strong>Vedanānupassanā</strong>—observation of sensations within the body. See <strong>satipaṭṭhāna</strong>.

</p>

<p>
    <strong>viññāṇa</strong>. Consciousness, cognition. One of the four mental aggregates or processes, along with <strong>saññā</strong>, <strong>vedanā</strong>, and <strong>saṅkhāra</strong>.

</p>

<p>
    <strong>vipassanā</strong>. Introspection, insight that totally purifies the mind. Specifically, insight into the impermanent nature of mind and body. <strong>Vipassanā-bhāvanā</strong>—the systematic development of insight through the meditation technique of observing the reality of oneself by observing sensations within the body.

</p>

<p>
    <strong>yathā-bhūta</strong>. Literally, "as it is." Reality.

</p>

<p>
    <strong>yathā-bhūta-ñāṇa-dassana</strong>. Wisdom arising from seeing the truth as it is.
